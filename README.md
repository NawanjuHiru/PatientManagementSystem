## Setup Instructions

1. **Backend Setup (Spring Boot)**
   - Ensure you have Java 17+ and Maven installed.
   - Navigate to the backend project directory.
   - Configure the database connection in `application.properties` (H2 or other).
   - Run the application:
     ```bash
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```
   - The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8080/api`.

2. **Frontend Setup (Angular)**
   - Ensure you have Node.js and Angular CLI installed.
   - Navigate to the frontend project directory.
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Run the Angular development server:
     ```bash
     ng serve
     ```
   - Access the frontend at `http://localhost:4200`.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:**
  - Java 17
  - Spring Boot
  - Spring Data JPA
  - H2 Database (in-memory)
  - Maven

- **Frontend:**
  - Angular 15+
  - Angular Material
  - RxJS
  - TypeScript
  - HTML5 & CSS3

---

## Assumptions Made

- Patient `id` is auto-generated by the backend.
- Date format is `YYYY-MM-DD` for both backend and frontend.
- The system runs locally and uses CORS configured for localhost ports 4200 (frontend) and 8080 (backend).
- No authentication or authorization is implemented in this version.
- The H2 database is used for development and testing purposes; a production-grade database would be required for deployment.
